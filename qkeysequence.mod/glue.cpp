// NOTES :
// The moc4glue.cpp file is generated by running :  moc.sh
// It generates the custom Signal/Slot handler code that Qt uses.
// The file only needs to be re-generated whenever a new slot is added/changed to a class,
// or a new class includes the Q_OBJECT macro.
// Oh.. and it NEEDS to be at the bottom of this file, because of declarations and whatnot.
